agar.io mouse wheel zoom out patch
==================================
_by: summivox_


Usage
-----

Scroll mouse wheel to zoom out (i.e. to have wider field of view).


Important Notes
---------------

1.  Because the game server only tells the game client about cells that are close enough to you, there is a limit on how far you can see from yourself that cannot be circumvented. This extension only reveals what the server already told the game client but haven't come into your "screen" yet.
2.  This extension patches the game client source on-the-fly and therefore should still work even after minor game client updates.


Revision History
----------------

* __2015/05/20 v0.1.0__:  
  Initial release. Only zooming.
